# Project Discovery: Next-Gen Cinematic Portfolio

## Core Vision
Act as the top 1% frontend engineers on Earth — engineers who build award-winning websites for Apple, Vercel, Stripe, and Awwwards Site of the Year winners.
This portfolio is not a website — it is an interactive experience that tells a story about skill, ambition, and engineering excellence.

## 1. Scroll-Synced Background Video (MANDATORY)
- **Concept**: The entire site uses a full-screen background video or canvas animation.
- **Behavior**: 
  - The video does NOT autoplay.
  - It is 100% scroll-driven.
  - Frames advance forward or backward based on scroll direction.
  - Motion feels physically tied to the scroll.
  - Every scroll pixel has meaning.
- **Tech Ref**: GSAP ScrollTrigger, requestAnimationFrame, frame-by-frame canvas rendering.
- **Vibe**: Cinematic, intentional, premium.

## 2. Lenis + Butter-Smooth Scrolling
- **Library**: Lenis.
- **Feel**: Heavy but fluid, slightly inertial, ultra-premium (like Apple.com or Linear.app).
- **Integration**: Combine with scroll-triggered animations.
- **Constraint**: Zero jank, zero lag, zero compromises.

## 3. Excessive Animation & Interaction (Exaggerated)
- **Reactivity**: Everything reacts.
- **Text**: Reveals on scroll, letters split and animate individually.
- **Sections**: Morph into each other.
- **Depth**: Elements parallax at different depths.
- **Micro-interactions**: Hover distortion, magnetic buttons, cursor follows/expands/warps.
- **Vibe**: Purposeful, over-engineered, obsessively polished.

## 4. Required Sections (Story-Driven)
### Hero Section
- Full viewport.
- Bold statement: "I design and engineer digital experiences."
- Animated typography.
- Scroll cue that invites exploration.

### Tech Stack
- Logos or text floating in 3D space.
- Tech: React, Next.js, Node, MongoDB, etc.
- Each tech reacts to scroll and hover.

### Experience
- Timeline that reveals as you scroll.
- Lines draw themselves.
- Cards slide, fade, and stack.

### Projects
- Large project cards.
- Hover = reveal video previews.
- Click = immersive case study transition.

### About Me
- Minimal but emotional.
- Focus on mindset, curiosity, obsession with craft.
- Human + engineer blend.

### Contact Me
- Strong final call-to-action.
- Animated form or magnetic email button.
- Ends the story with confidence.

## 5. Engineering Standard (Non-Negotiable)
- **Code Quality**: Top 1% global standard.
- **Architecture**: Modular, performant, scalable.
- **Metrics**: 60fps animations, GPU acceleration, accessibility-aware motion.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React (JSX)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS
- **Animation**: GSAP, Framer Motion
- **Scrolling**: Lenis
